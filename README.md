# SameGame

One night about 10 years ago (early 2008), I threw together a quick implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SameGame">SameGame</a>. It's a tile-matching puzzle game I played (way too much) on Windows 95.

I recently found the files again. The code is... rough. But the game is playable. I thought it might be fun to revisit and refactor a bit.

> Side note: The "early 2008" date is based on the jQuery version. The game used version 1.2.3, which was [released](https://blog.jquery.com/2008/02/07/jquery-1-2-3-released/) on Feb. 7, 2008. The next version was [released](http://blog.jquery.com/2008/05/20/jquery-1-2-4-released/) on May 20, 2008.
